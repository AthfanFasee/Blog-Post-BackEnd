# Blog-Post-BackEnd

A site where users can create, update and delete their own blogs. I have created my own REST APIs for this site.
It has multiple sorting options and pagination. Users can like a post or add comments.
The likes count and new comments are rendered in real-time.
All the Errors are properly handled at the back-end and properly displayed at the front-end in a user-friendly manner.
I used JWT tokens for authentication and multiple security packages like helmet to prevent numerous possible attacks and XSS-clean to filter user inputs and prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
I have used Material UI in required places to make the front-end look solid.
And finally, I have written tests for both front-end and back-end completely, and also this site is fully responsive.

Tools Used  :  JavaScript, React,  MUI,  Sass(Css),  NodeJS,  Express,  Axios,  MongoDB,  Jest,  Helmet
